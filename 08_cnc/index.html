<h4>Assignment: Make Something With CNC</h4>


This week I thought I could use the assignment as a chance to make a gift for my friend to congratulate her on her stint as the vice president of the club we’re both in. The club has a logo which is a pudding pot set above an open flame. I wanted to CNC something for her in that vein. 

The club has a logo which looks like this


<p class="margin">   </p>
<div class="class\">
  <img src="HPT-Pudding-Pot-300x267.png">
</div>
<p class="caption">Pudding Pot!</p>

So I downloaded a vector works app and tried to recreate something like it. At first, this seemed like a great idea until I tried opening what I’d drawn in fusion and saw this:

<p class="margin">   </p>
<div class="class\">
  <img src="CNCattampe1.png">
  <img src="CNCattempt1problems.png">
</div>
<p class="caption">Uh Oh...</p>

<p class="margin">   </p>


Unfortunately, none of the lines really connected, even though they looked like they did from a distance. I had to start over basically, which I did solely in Fusion using simple geometries. This was the end result:


<p class="margin">   </p>
<div class="flexrow">
  <img src="cnc_completed.png" alt="">
</div>
<div class="flexrow">
<p class="caption">Made completely in fusion.</p>

<p class="margin">   </p>

It’s not as pretty, but it gets the idea across well enough I think. Bobby (the GOAT of all time) helped me to work the shop bot to mill it out of a piece of wood. 

<p class="margin">   </p>
<div class="flexrow">
  <img src="week8cnc.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<div class="flexrow">
</div>


It came out ok, except for that the letters got messed up. I think they were too small for the end mill was wasn’t fine enough. If I were to do it over, I’d either use a smaller end mill bit or just scale the entire thing up so that the letters don’t fly off. But overall this was a successful project which Ava really enjoyed when I gifted it to her.
