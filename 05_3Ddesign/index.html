<h4>Assignment: Design and Print Something</h4>

This week we started by having to 3D print something. For this assignment I wanted to make one of those little gyroscope fidget toy thingies. I’ve seen them be 3D printed before (there are some examples in the lab, and it’s not something easily made with subtractive methods. The basic idea was to make concentric rings that would themselves increase in diameter as you got further up on their z axis. The increase in diameter would need to be such that at the center z point of any given ring where it’s the widest, it is wider than the ring around it. At first I wasn’t really sure how to actually model this. I was used to making things from a top down perspective, where I would sketch them from the top and then just extrude the geometries to the depths they needed to be. This wasn’t possible here, because the rings needed to be extruded at variable depths along the axes. Instead, the best way I found to accomplish the desired shape was actually to model just the radial cross section of all the rings, and then pivot that cross section around the center of the rings.

After this I was able to export the model as an STL file and upload it to Prusa where I printed it. You can find the stl file linked here on the website.


The finished result was pretty cool, and it worked basically exactly how I wanted it to.

As far as my plan for my final project goes… doing this documentation with hindsight… I certainly had some lofty ambitions

The idea was to make a scanning machine on a gantry and I did sort of accomplish that. At the time I didn’t know what materials I’d use or anything besides the idea that I’d probably need a stepper motor and an ultrasonic sensor. Those things were both true in the literal sense. While the project didn’t end up looking like this, and certainly the second half about making something that would draw what was being scanned didn’t come true, it’s honestly scary how close the original vision was to what I produced.
