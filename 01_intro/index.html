<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class="margin">   </p>
I have two ideas for my final project. The first idea is a machine to help me draw in curvilinear perspecive, and the second would be a musical machine that would actively harmonize with my voice when singing.

<p class="margin">   </p>
<h4>Idea 1: Curvilinear Perspective Machine</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>
I think it is pretty intuitive to most people with a basic art knowledge how one, two, and three-point perspectives work. Drawing in perspective is an attempt to project the 3 dimensional world our eyes see onto a 2D surface. By drawing different objects in reference to vanishing points (usually) placed along a horizon, you achieve a foreshortening effect that recreates the view of the human eye more faithfully than just drawing the objects  randomly in space. With one point perspective, you have all the foreshortening happen towards, one vanishing point along the horizon. With two point perspective you have a similar case with two points, which allows you to draw things at an angle. If you add a third point, either above or below the horizon, you can effectively raise or lower the position of the viewer by moving the vertical axis further away from the them on one end, which can allow for some super cool effects. Once you start adding more than three vanishing points, you start encountering curvilinear perspective. You can think of this perspective as a kind of fish-eye lens effect. With two vertical vanishing points, the vertical lines of our drawing will start to curve and bulge out in the center. If three-point perspective allows you to look at something from above or below, four-point perspective allows you to look at a scene and places things both above and below you at once. Then you can add an additional point of perspective for five-point perspective. In this case, What you see is being projected onto a hemisphere with the 5th vanishing point at the center. This essentially allows you to draw a full 180 degrees in both the horizontal and vertical direction. 

<p class="margin">   </p>
Something cool about perspective is that it's actually pretty mathematical. Being that it's a projection, there are formulas that can take the xyz coordinates of an object as it relates to the point of view origin, and then translate that to the exact 2D position on the drawing surface. My (very ambitious) idea is this: create a machine that uses a laser pointer fixed to an origin to establish appropriate vanishing points for drawing in either 4 or 5 point perspective, and then a second laser pointer that the user manually "scans" the outline of something they would like to draw in that perspective, and the machine will translate that two a piece of paper. Ideally this would be able to draw cubes and rectangular prisms anywhere in a space as they pertain to an established vanishing point.

<h4>Idea 2: Mechanical Piano Accompanist</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>
I like to sing, but I'm very bad at playing the piano. It would be cool to have a robot that could do it for me! Imagine a scenario where you can tell a machine what key you intend to sing in and maybe provide some prompts for a specific feel, and then it would spontaneously play chords that match the notes you're singing? I imagine this robot can actively "hear" you sing, determine the note you're singing and even make predictions about where the melody might go next, and then using it's internal knowledge of music theory, play chords that will make you sound nice no matter what.

<p class="margin">   </p>
I see this robot as being an attachment that goes onto a piano and spans one (or maybe two if I'm being ambitious) octaves. It listens for your voice and then using it's code, determines what notes to play and then presses the appropriate keys on the piano!
