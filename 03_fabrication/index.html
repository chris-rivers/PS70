<p><span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;'>My original plan for the kinetic sculpture was to make some kind of clock, but life got kind of crazy and I ended up missing the week&apos;s assignment and having to make it up later in the semester. I ended up pivoting to a project that had 2 fewer hands than a clock, which is to say it would have one hand. The basic idea I had was to cut out pieces of cardboard to look like a human hand. I wanted to have 10 pieces (one for the palm, one for the thumb, and then 2 pieces for each other finger), which would be joined together by some semi-rigid structure. Then I could use string to join the tips of each finger with a spinning motor or crank, which would make the hand seem like it was curling and uncurling as the driver turned.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;'>First I went through and tried to model the pieces I&rsquo;d need to cut in Fusion 360&hellip; As usual this was a painful process.The final result looked&hellip; fine. Certainly not my best work but not my worst either! In hindsight I realized that in order for the motion of the fingers to be detectable, I&rsquo;d need the distance the motor moved them to be much larger than what the little axel on the stepper motor I had could provide, but this was a good start.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="caption">The hand cuts!</p>

<p><span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;'>A trip quick to the laser cutter and I had all the pieces I&rsquo;d need&hellip; except for the semi rigid structure that would basically make the frame of the hand. For that I took some zipties, and just hot glued them right to the hand pieces. I bent them a couple times to establish creases at the locations I wanted to bend when the sculpture moved suddenly I had something that looked pretty hand shaped. Before I put the strings on, I spent a few minutes building a pedestal for the hand to rest on. Without it, the hand would just be pulled by the string rather than the fingers curling. I just used some plywood and a 1x1 piece of wood for this. After that I mounted the hand onto the pedestal with a drywall screw, and then taped the strings onto each finger.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size: 11pt; font-family: "Lucida Console", Monaco, monospace;'>Like I mentioned earlier, the movement is kind of lame and I think this is because of the small radius of the hand crank. The next version will involve a motor and something to increase the radius it turns so that the motion is more visible. </span></p>
